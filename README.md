## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kerem Kazan. I've been a professional product oriented `full stack software engineer` since 2016, and I'm currently focusing on `infrastructure`, `smart contract engineering` and `dApp architecture`. Check out my Twitter ([@mechaturka](https://twitter.com/@mechaturka)) if you're interested in software philosophy and meditation.

### Currently Building

- [towns.com](towns.com): Towns is a decentralized, realtime, e2e encrypted, community and messaging social experience, built on our in-house developed River protocol. Think discord but decentralized and open-source. I help with infrastructure, o11y, build systems and smart contracts.

- [@whatsgood/nexus](https://nexus.whatsgood.dog): Nexus is a multi-chain, hyper-customizable, performant and cost-saving rpc proxy library, written in TypeScript. It ships with built-in authorization, route filters, caching and observability. Behavior can be enhanced through configuration, middlewares and event handlers. Currently supporting CloudFlare, FastifyJS, Node, ExpressJS.

### Previous Web3 Projects

- [sound.xyz](https://www.sound.xyz): Sound is an artist-first, community driven music nft  platform. I helped them with client-side web3 integration, infrastructure, observability and GraphQL APIs.

### Recent Accomplishments

- Won the [Product Hunt Golden Kitty Award for Social Impact](https://www.producthunt.com/products/matter) with my team at [Matter](https://matterapp.com)
- Co-Founded and served as Head of Engineering to a 25-people strong venture backed high end fashion tech startup called [appreciate.it](https://appreciate.it).
- Completed the [0xmacro Secure Smart Contract Engineering Fellowship](https://0xmacro.com/engineering-fellowship) with `honors tier`, an accomplishment that has been awarded historically to about 1-2 engineers per cohort. 
- Co-Inventor of pending patent application: "Automated Platform for Performance Feedback"
- 45 `stars` on [Uniform GraphQL](https://uniform-graphql.whatsgood.dog/), an open source project I authored for building code-first GraphQL apis in TypeScript.
- 36 `stars` on [VulcanJS CLI](https://github.com/VulcanJS/vulcanjs-cli), an open source CLI tool I co-authored for a `GraphQL` + `React` + `MeteorJS` full stack framework called `VulcanJS`.

### Web3 Project Portfolio:

- [Crowdfunder](https://github.com/mechanical-turk/solidity-crowdfund): a crowdfunding protocol with a target goal, deadline, refunding and withdrawal features, written in Solidity
- [ICO Protocol + Frontend](https://github.com/mechanical-turk/solidity-ico): a multi-phasic ICO protocol for a tax-on-trade token, with whitelisting, phase-based target supply, individual contribution limits, along with a reference frontend application
- [DAO Protocol](https://github.com/mechanical-turk/solidity-collector-dao): a DAO protocol built with the intention to buy and collect NFTs as a collective, with proposals, voting, membership and eip712 signature vote casting features
- [Liquidity Pool Protocol + Frontend](https://github.com/mechanical-turk/solidity-lp): a uniswap-like liquidity pool implementation along with a reference frontend application

### Parting Words

I believe our creations speak volumes about who we are. Not necessarily what we create, but definitely how we create, is almost like a microscope into our minds. To me, there's little that beats the feeling of overcoming oneself. Second to that is the joy of a job well done. For these reasons, I feel home when I get to be a part of a team of self-driven individuals who respect their crafts, taking on difficult challenges together while learning, growing, and intellectually nourishing one another. If you agree and want to connect for whatever reason, DM me on twitter [@mechaturka
