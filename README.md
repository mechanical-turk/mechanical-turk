### Parting Words

I believe our creations speak volumes about who we are. Not necessarily what we create, but definitely how we create, is almost like a microscope into our minds. To me, there's little that beats the feeling of overcoming oneself. Second to that is the joy of a job well done. For these reasons, I feel home when I get to be a part of a team of self-driven individuals who respect their crafts, taking on difficult challenges together while learning, growing, and intellectually nourishing one another.
